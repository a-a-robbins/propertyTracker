# Property Tacker
## Points: 15

## Submission
`commit` and `push` your code to the `master` branch on the remote GitHub repository **before** the deadline.

## Clone
`clone` this repo to repl.it or your local machine using the link provided on the GitHub repo page.

Use the included files as your template to start the program maintaining the filenames given.

## Description
This assignment will make use of structs and reading from files.

For this assignment you must create an array of `struct`s that will record the rental properties that a person owns.

The goal of this assignment is to have you read in this information from a file and save it into an array of structures which represent the inventory items.

You need to complete the following operations on the data:
1. Calculate total rental **income** for Owner1
2. Calculate total maintenance costs for Owner2
3. Average price per bedroom for each owners
4. Count # of houses owned by each owner (search for the string `house`)
5. Average price of all properties (combining both owners)

**A max of 50 properties per owner will be read in from the file.**

### Input file format
The input file will have the following format:
```
1st line is the number of properties for the owner
2nd line is the type of property (house, apartment, condo, etc.)
3rd line is the monthly rental cost
4th line is the monthly maintenance cost
5th line is number of bedrooms
6th line is number of bathrooms

lines 2-6 will repeat for as many times specified in line 1
There will be 2 input files; each file will have one set of data.
```

**NOTE:** There are 2 separate files listed below

Example of an input files format:
```
2
house
1200.00
755.33
3
2
apartment
600.00
200.00
2
1
```
```
3
house
700.33
100.22
4
2
house
770.94
350.32
2
2
condo
2000.22
1400.00
1
1
```

**Sample inputs file are provided, please add your input to the `input1.txt` and `intput2.txt` files for testing in Repl.it**

### Requirements
* Use the given template and **filename** for your submission.
* You must use functions in an appropriate way
* Your program must read input from two files in the proper format, NOT stdin
* Your program should accept the filenames from the command-line as shown in the example below
* You should use two separate structure arrays
    * These arrays should use the **same** structure definition, because they are storing the same type of data

#### Required Functions
```c
int readProps(FILE *ifp, prop O[]);
double totalIncome(prop O[], int num);
double totalCost(prop O[], int num);
double pricePerBed(prop O[], int num);
int numHouses(prop O[], int num);
```

#### Optional Functions
Additional functions may be used for debugging or while you are developing your program, a useful example is a function to print off some of the properties of one item.
```c
void printProps(prop O[], int num);
```

### Example Output
```
$ ./a.out infile1.txt infile2.txt
Total income Owner1: $1800.00
Total cost Owner2: $1850.54
Average price per bedroom Owner1: $360.00
Average price per bedroom Owner2: $495.93
# of Houses Owner1: 1
# of Houses Owner2: 2
Average price of all properties: $1054.30
```
